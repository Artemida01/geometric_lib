# Geometric Lib

## Contains functions for 4 geometric figures:

* *Rectangle*
* *Square*
* *Circle*
* *Triangle*

### Circle:
* `def area` Receives *radius* of the circle and returns its area.
* `def perimeter` Receives *radius* of the circle and returns its perimeter.

### Rectangle:
* `def area` Receives *length of 2 sides* and returns area of the rectangle.
* `def perimeter` Receives *length of 2 sides* and returns perimeter of the rectangle.

### Square:
* `def area` Receives *length of the side* and returns area of the square.
* `def perimeter` Receives *length of the side* and returns perimeter of the square.

### Triangle:
* `def area` Receives *length of the side and height* of the triangle and returns its area.
* `def perimeter` Receives *length of 3 sides* of the triangle and returns its perimeter.

## Usage examples
* **Circle**
  >def area(5) -> 25 * pi
  >
  >def perimetr(5) -> 10 * pi

* **Rectangle**
  >def area(2, 3) -> 6
  > 
  >def perimetr(2, 3) -> 10

* **Square**
  >def area(5) -> 25
  > 
  >def perimetr(5) -> 20

* **Triangle**
    >def area(6, 3) -> 9
    >
    >def perimetr(3, 4, 5) -> 12
